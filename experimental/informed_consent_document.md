# Full Informed Consent Document

## Study Summary

You are being invited to allow your child to participate in a research study because your child is potentially eligible due to their admission to a Pediatric or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study, called the "PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS (PRECISE)," aims to explore new ways to treat children with this condition by tailoring treatments to their specific immune responses.

Sepsis is a serious condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In some cases, this can lead to MODS, where multiple organ systems in the body stop working properly. Current treatments for sepsis focus on antibiotics and supportive care, but there is a need for more personalized approaches that consider the unique immune responses of each child.

The PRECISE study is designed to test whether personalized treatments can improve outcomes for children with sepsis-induced MODS. The study involves two main trials: the GRACE-2 trial and the TRIPS trial. These trials will test different treatments based on your child's specific immune response. The GRACE-2 trial will focus on children with a suppressed immune response, while the TRIPS trial will focus on those with an overactive immune response.

Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If you choose to allow your child to participate, they will undergo a series of tests to determine their immune response. Based on these results, they may receive one of the study treatments or be part of an observational group. The study treatments involve medications that are already approved for other uses but are being tested here for their potential to help children with sepsis-induced MODS.

There are potential risks and benefits to participating in this study. The risks include possible side effects from the study medications, such as fever, chills, or changes in blood cell counts. There is also a risk of discomfort from blood draws and other procedures. However, the study team will closely monitor your child to manage any side effects that occur.

The potential benefits of participating include the possibility of improved health outcomes for your child if the study treatments are effective. Additionally, the information gained from this study may help improve treatments for other children with sepsis-induced MODS in the future.

Your decision to allow your child to participate in this study is completely voluntary. You may choose not to participate, or you may withdraw your child from the study at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits to which your child is otherwise entitled. The care your child receives will not be affected by your decision.

If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign a consent form, and the study team will provide you with more detailed information about the study procedures, potential risks, and benefits. You will have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have before making your decision.

Thank you for considering this important research study. Your participation could contribute to advancing medical knowledge and improving care for children with sepsis-induced MODS.

## Background

You are being invited to participate in a research study focused on improving the treatment of a serious condition known as sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in children. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. When sepsis leads to the failure of multiple organs, it is referred to as MODS. This condition is a major cause of illness and death in critically ill children, and current treatments are primarily supportive, such as providing antibiotics and managing symptoms.

The study you are being considered for is called the PRECISE study, which stands for PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS. This study is part of a larger effort by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network to explore new ways to treat sepsis-induced MODS by tailoring treatments to the specific needs of each child based on their immune system's response to the infection.

The PRECISE study involves two main trials: the GRACE-2 trial and the TRIPS trial. These trials are designed to test different approaches to modulating, or adjusting, the immune system's response in children with sepsis-induced MODS. The goal is to improve outcomes by either boosting the immune system when it is too weak or calming it down when it is too active.

In the GRACE-2 trial, researchers are investigating the use of a drug called GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). GM-CSF is a naturally occurring protein in the body that stimulates the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting infections. The researchers believe that by administering GM-CSF, they can help children whose immune systems are not responding adequately to the infection, a condition known as immunoparalysis. This approach aims to enhance the body's ability to fight off the infection and recover from organ dysfunction.

The TRIPS trial, on the other hand, is focused on children who have a different immune response characterized by excessive inflammation. In this trial, the drug anakinra is being tested. Anakinra is an anti-inflammatory medication that blocks the activity of a specific protein called interleukin-1, which plays a role in the inflammatory response. By using anakinra, the researchers hope to reduce harmful inflammation in children with sepsis-induced MODS, potentially leading to better recovery and outcomes.

The decision to include you in this study is based on specific criteria related to your immune system's response to sepsis. Researchers will conduct tests to determine your immune phenotype, which is a way of categorizing your immune response. Depending on the results, you may be eligible for one of the trials or be part of an observational group that helps researchers understand the condition better without receiving the study drugs.

The scientific rationale behind these interventions is grounded in previous research that has identified distinct immune response patterns in children with sepsis-induced MODS. By targeting these specific patterns with tailored treatments, the study aims to provide more effective care and improve the chances of recovery for children affected by this severe condition.

Your participation in this study could contribute to important scientific knowledge that may lead to better treatments for sepsis-induced MODS in the future.

## Study Procedures

### Screening and Enrollment

When you are admitted to the pediatric or cardiac intensive care unit, you will be evaluated to see if you are eligible for our study. This evaluation will involve checking if you meet certain criteria related to your health condition. If you are eligible, we will ask your legal guardian(s) for permission to include you in the study. This initial step is crucial as it helps us determine if you can participate in the study based on your current health status.

### Immune Phenotyping

If you are eligible and your guardian consents, we will perform a process called immune phenotyping. This involves taking a small blood sample from you on the second day after the onset of your condition, known as sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The blood sample will be used to measure certain immune responses and inflammatory markers, such as TNFα production capacity, serum ferritin levels, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. These tests help us understand your immune system's response to the illness and determine the best course of action for your treatment within the study.

### Randomization and Study Drug Administration

Based on the results of your immune phenotyping, you may be eligible to receive a study drug. If you qualify, you will be randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or a placebo. This process is called randomization and ensures that the study results are unbiased. The study drug will be administered intravenously, meaning it will be given through a vein, over a period of time. The specific drug and dosage will depend on your immune response and inflammation levels as determined by the phenotyping.

### Follow-up Immune Function Testing

Throughout the study, we will continue to monitor your immune function. This involves taking additional blood samples at specific intervals to measure the same markers as before. These follow-up tests help us track how your immune system is responding to the study drug and whether there are any changes in your condition. The samples will be processed and analyzed to provide insights into your treatment progress.

### Biorepository Sample Collection

As part of the study, we will collect additional biological samples, such as serum, plasma, and possibly endotracheal aspirates if you are intubated. These samples will be stored in a biorepository for future analysis related to the study. The collection of these samples is important for understanding the broader effects of the study drug and the underlying biology of your condition.

### Data Collection and Monitoring

Throughout your participation in the study, we will collect various types of data, including demographic information, eligibility data, and details about your health status and treatment. This data will be securely stored and used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the study drug. We will also monitor for any adverse events or changes in your condition that may occur during the study.

### Discontinuation or Withdrawal

You or your guardian may choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time. If you decide to stop participating, we will cease all study-related procedures and data collection. However, we will continue to review any data collected prior to your withdrawal to ensure the integrity of the study.

### Conclusion

These procedures are designed to ensure that we gather accurate and comprehensive information about your condition and the effects of the study drug. Your participation is valuable in helping us understand and improve treatments for sepsis-induced MODS in children.

## Alternative Procedures

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not need to be part of this study to receive high-quality care for sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The medical team in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) will continue to provide state-of-the-art critical care, which includes monitoring and treating sepsis and its complications. This care is based on the best available medical practices and guidelines.

Currently, the monitoring of immune function and the specific treatments being studied, such as personalized immunomodulation, are not part of routine care in the ICU. These investigational treatments aim to improve outcomes by targeting the immune response, but they are not yet standard practice. If you choose not to participate, your child will still receive all the necessary medical interventions to manage sepsis and MODS, including antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive therapies as needed.

If at any point you decide to withdraw from the study, you can do so without any impact on the care your child receives. The decision to participate or not will not affect your relationship with the medical staff or the quality of care provided. Your child's health and well-being remain the top priority, and the medical team will continue to use all available resources to ensure the best possible outcomes.
