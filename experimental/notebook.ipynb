       "\n",
       "You are being invited to allow your child to participate in a research study because your child is potentially eligible due to their admission to the Pediatric or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study, known as the PRECISE study, aims to explore new ways to treat children with sepsis-induced MODS by personalizing their care based on their immune system's response to infection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sepsis is a serious condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In some cases, this can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), where two or more organ systems in the body stop working properly. The current treatment for sepsis primarily involves antibiotics and supportive care, such as fluids and medications to support blood pressure. However, these treatments are not tailored to the specific needs of each child, and there is a need for more personalized approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "The PRECISE study is designed to address this need by identifying specific immune system patterns, or \"phenotypes,\" in children with sepsis-induced MODS. By understanding these patterns, researchers hope to provide treatments that are more closely aligned with each child's unique immune response. The study involves two main trials: the GRACE-2 trial, which tests a drug called GM-CSF to boost the immune system, and the TRIPS trial, which tests a drug called anakinra to reduce inflammation. Both drugs are being compared to a placebo, which is a substance with no active medication, to determine their effectiveness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you can choose to withdraw your child at any time without affecting their medical care. If you decide to allow your child to participate, they will undergo a series of tests to determine their immune phenotype. Based on these results, they may be enrolled in one of the trials or placed in an observational group if they do not meet the criteria for the trials.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are potential risks and benefits to participating in this study. The risks include possible side effects from the study drugs, such as fever, chills, or allergic reactions. There is also a risk of discomfort from blood draws and other procedures. However, the study is designed to minimize these risks, and your child's health will be closely monitored throughout the study.\n",
       "\n",
       "The potential benefits of participating include access to new treatments that may improve your child's condition and contribute to medical knowledge that could help other children in the future. While there is no guarantee that your child will benefit directly from the study, the information gained may lead to better treatments for sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "Your decision to allow your child to participate should be based on a careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. If you have any questions or concerns, the study team is available to provide more information and support. Your child's participation is important, but it is entirely your choice, and your decision will be respected regardless of whether you choose to participate.\n",

       "## Background\n",
       "\n",
       "You are being invited to participate in a research study focused on improving the treatment of sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in children. Sepsis is a serious medical condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes widespread inflammation, leading to organ failure. MODS is a severe complication of sepsis where multiple organs in the body stop functioning properly. This condition is life-threatening and requires intensive medical care.\n",
       "\n",
       "The study you are being considered for is called the PRECISE study, which stands for PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS. The goal of this study is to explore new ways to treat sepsis-induced MODS by tailoring treatments to the specific immune responses of individual patients. This personalized approach is based on the understanding that children with sepsis can have different immune system reactions, which may require different treatment strategies.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this study, researchers are investigating two main treatment strategies. The first strategy involves using a drug called GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) to boost the immune system in children whose immune response is too weak. GM-CSF is a naturally occurring protein in the body that helps stimulate the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting infections. By enhancing the immune response, the researchers hope to improve the body's ability to clear infections and recover from organ dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second strategy involves using a drug called anakinra to reduce excessive inflammation in children whose immune response is too strong. Anakinra is a medication that blocks the activity of a specific protein called interleukin-1, which plays a key role in the inflammatory process. By reducing inflammation, the researchers aim to prevent further damage to the organs and promote healing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The scientific basis for these interventions comes from previous studies that have shown distinct immune system patterns in children with sepsis-induced MODS. Some children exhibit a suppressed immune response, making them more vulnerable to infections, while others show signs of excessive inflammation, which can lead to further organ damage. By identifying these patterns, the researchers believe they can provide more effective and targeted treatments.\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation in this study could contribute to a better understanding of how personalized treatments can improve outcomes for children with sepsis-induced MODS. The knowledge gained from this research may help develop new treatment guidelines and improve the care of critically ill children in the future.\n",

       "This study, titled \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS (PRECISE),\" is being conducted across multiple hospitals within the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). The network includes renowned institutions such as Children's Hospital of Colorado, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, and Nationwide Children's Hospital, among others. The study is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The protocol aims to enroll up to 1,095 participants to achieve the target of 500 patients for the TRIPS trial component. Enrollment is expected to occur over a period that aligns with the study's objectives, although the exact duration is not specified in the provided context. Participants will be critically ill children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and the study will explore personalized immune modulation strategies to improve outcomes.\n",

       "## Study Procedures\n",
       "\n",
       "In this study, we will conduct a series of procedures to understand and potentially improve outcomes for children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Below, we outline the steps and procedures you will undergo if you decide to participate in this study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Screening and Enrollment\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon admission to the pediatric or cardiac intensive care unit (ICU), we will evaluate your eligibility for the study. If you meet the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are present, we will approach your legal guardian(s) to discuss participation. If they agree, you will be enrolled in the study, and we will proceed with the next steps.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "On the second day after the onset of sepsis-induced MODS, we will perform immune phenotyping. This involves taking a small blood sample (approximately 2 ml) to measure your immune response and levels of certain inflammatory markers, such as serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP). The blood sample will be stimulated on-site and then shipped to a specialized laboratory for analysis. This process helps us determine your immune status and decide the appropriate study intervention.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Randomization and Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the results of your immune phenotyping, you may be eligible for one of two trials: the GRACE-2 trial or the TRIPS trial. If you qualify, you will be randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or a placebo. The study drug will be administered intravenously over a specified period, and the dosage will depend on your specific immune profile.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### GRACE-2 Trial\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are enrolled in the GRACE-2 trial, you will receive GM-CSF or a placebo. The drug will be infused over at least six hours daily for seven days. We will monitor your white blood cell count to ensure it remains within safe limits.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### TRIPS Trial\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are enrolled in the TRIPS trial, you will receive anakinra or a placebo. The drug will be administered every 12 hours for seven days. We will adjust the dose if you have severe renal dysfunction to ensure safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Follow-up Immune Function Testing\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout the study, we will conduct follow-up immune function tests to monitor your response to the study drug. These tests will include additional blood samples taken twice weekly for two weeks. The samples will be processed locally and shipped to the laboratory for analysis. This will help us understand how the study drug affects your immune system and overall health.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Biorepository Sample Collection\n",
       "\n",
       "We will collect additional biological samples, such as serum, plasma, RNA, and DNA, for future research. These samples will be stored in a biorepository and may be used to study the biology of immune function and inflammation in children with sepsis-induced MODS. You will have the option to consent to the use of these samples for future studies unrelated to this protocol.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Collection and Monitoring\n",
       "\n",
       "We will collect various data throughout the study, including demographic information, eligibility data, and daily health status. We will also monitor any adverse events or changes in your condition. This data will help us assess the effectiveness and safety of the study interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Discontinuation or Withdrawal\n",
       "\n",
       "You may discontinue the study drug if an adverse event occurs or if your legal guardians request it. If you withdraw from the study, we will stop all study procedures and data collection, but we will continue to review any data collected before your withdrawal.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Quality of Life Assessments\n",
       "\n",
       "We will assess your quality of life using specific instruments at the beginning of the study and at follow-up intervals. These assessments will help us understand the impact of the study interventions on your overall well-being.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "These procedures are designed to help us better understand and potentially improve the treatment of sepsis-induced MODS in children. Your participation is crucial in advancing our knowledge and developing more effective therapies.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Alternative Procedures\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not need to be part of this study to receive high-quality care for sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in a pediatric intensive care unit. The medical team will continue to provide state-of-the-art critical care based on current medical standards, regardless of your decision to participate. This includes the use of antibiotics and supportive care measures such as fluid resuscitation and the use of medications to support heart and lung function. \n",
       "\n",
       "Currently, monitoring of immune function and personalized immunomodulation treatments are not part of routine care in pediatric ICUs. The study aims to explore whether specific treatments can improve outcomes by targeting the immune system, but these treatments are not yet standard practice. If you choose not to participate, your child will still receive all the necessary medical interventions that are typically used to manage sepsis and MODS. \n",
       "\n",
       "You can decide to stop participating in the study at any time, and this will not affect the care your child receives. If you choose to withdraw from the study, the medical team will continue to provide all necessary treatments as per standard care protocols. Your decision to participate or not will not impact the quality of care your child receives in any way.\n",

       "\n",
       "You are being invited to allow your child to participate in a research study because your child is potentially eligible due to their admission to the Pediatric or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study, known as the PRECISE study, aims to explore new ways to treat children with sepsis-induced MODS by personalizing their care based on their immune system's response to the infection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sepsis is a serious condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In some cases, this can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), where two or more organ systems in the body stop working properly. The current treatment for sepsis mainly involves antibiotics and supportive care, such as fluids and medications to support blood pressure. However, these treatments are not tailored to the specific needs of each child, and there is a need for more personalized approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "The PRECISE study is designed to address this need by identifying specific immune system patterns, or \"phenotypes,\" in children with sepsis-induced MODS. By understanding these patterns, researchers hope to provide treatments that are more closely aligned with each child's unique immune response. The study involves two main trials: the GRACE-2 trial, which tests a drug called GM-CSF to boost the immune system, and the TRIPS trial, which tests a drug called anakinra to reduce inflammation. Both drugs are being compared to a placebo, which is a substance with no active ingredients, to see if they are effective in improving outcomes for children with sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you can choose to withdraw your child at any time without affecting their medical care. If you decide to allow your child to participate, they will undergo a series of tests to determine their immune phenotype. Based on these results, they may be enrolled in one of the trials or placed in an observational group if they do not meet the criteria for the trials.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are potential risks and benefits to participating in this study. The risks include possible side effects from the study drugs, such as fever, chills, or allergic reactions. However, these risks are considered to be low, and the study team will closely monitor your child for any adverse effects. The potential benefits include the possibility of improved treatment outcomes for your child and the opportunity to contribute to research that may help other children with sepsis in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important to understand that participation in this study is not required for your child to receive the best possible care for their condition. The decision to participate should be made based on a careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits, and you are encouraged to ask any questions you may have before making a decision.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to important research that aims to improve the care and outcomes for children with sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Background\n",
       "\n",
       "You are being approached to participate in a study focused on improving the treatment of sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in children. Sepsis is a serious medical condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes widespread inflammation, leading to organ failure. MODS is a severe complication of sepsis where multiple organs in the body stop functioning properly. This condition is particularly dangerous in children and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.\n",
       "\n",
       "The study you are being considered for is called the \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS\" (PRECISE) study. This research aims to explore new ways to treat sepsis-induced MODS by tailoring treatments to the specific immune responses of individual patients. The study is being conducted by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network, which includes several leading children's hospitals and research centers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The PRECISE study is based on the understanding that children with sepsis-induced MODS can have different immune responses. Some children may have an overactive immune response, while others may have an underactive one. The study aims to identify these differences through a process called immunophenotyping, which involves analyzing blood samples to understand the immune system's behavior in each child.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once the immune response is understood, the study will use two different interventions to try to improve outcomes. The first intervention is called GM-CSF (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor), which is a naturally occurring protein in the body that stimulates the production of white blood cells. This intervention is being tested in a trial called GRACE-2, which aims to reverse immunoparalysis, a condition where the immune system is too weak to fight infections effectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second intervention involves a drug called anakinra, which is used to reduce inflammation by blocking a specific protein in the immune system known as interleukin-1. This intervention is part of the TRIPS trial, which targets children with excessive inflammation. By reducing inflammation, anakinra may help prevent further organ damage and improve recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "The scientific rationale behind these interventions is based on previous research that has shown the potential benefits of modulating the immune system in sepsis. For instance, GM-CSF has been used safely in other medical conditions to boost the immune system, and anakinra has been effective in reducing inflammation in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
       "\n",
       "By participating in this study, you will be contributing to important research that could lead to better treatments for sepsis-induced MODS in children. The goal is to personalize treatment based on each child's unique immune response, potentially improving survival rates and reducing the severity of organ dysfunction. Your involvement could help advance medical knowledge and lead to more effective therapies for children facing this life-threatening condition.\n",
       "\n",

       "## Number of Participants\n",
       "\n",
       "This study, titled \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS (PRECISE),\" is being conducted by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN), which includes multiple hospitals such as Children's Hospital of Colorado, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, and others. The study is supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The total number of participants planned for enrollment in the study is up to 1,095 patients. The study aims to accrue 500 patients specifically into the TRIPS trial component. The enrollment period for the study is expected to span a duration that allows for the comprehensive collection of data necessary to achieve the study's objectives. Participants will be enrolled from various CPCCRN-affiliated centers, ensuring a diverse and representative sample of the pediatric population affected by sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).\n",

       "## Study Procedures\n",
       "\n",
       "### Screening and Enrollment\n",
       "\n",
       "You will be evaluated for eligibility to participate in this study if you are admitted to the pediatric or cardiac intensive care unit. If you meet the initial criteria, we will record your information in our data system. If you are eligible, a member of our research team will approach your legal guardian(s) to discuss the study and offer the opportunity for you to participate. Your participation will involve immune phenotyping and potentially being part of an interventional trial based on the results of your immune phenotyping.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "On the second day after the onset of sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), we will perform immune function testing. This involves drawing approximately 2 milliliters of blood to measure your immune response and levels of certain inflammatory markers. The blood sample will be processed on-site and then shipped to a specialized laboratory for analysis. The results will help us determine your immune status and whether you qualify for further study interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Randomization and Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "If your immune phenotyping results indicate that you are eligible, you will be randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or a placebo. This process is called randomization and ensures that each participant has an equal chance of receiving the study drug. The study drug will be administered intravenously, meaning it will be given through a vein, over a period of time. The specific drug and dosage will depend on your immune status as determined by the phenotyping results.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### GRACE-2 Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are part of the GRACE-2 trial, you will receive the study drug or placebo intravenously over at least six hours daily for seven days. Before receiving the first and fourth doses, we will check your white blood cell count to ensure it is safe to proceed with the treatment. If your white blood cell count is too high, the study drug will be temporarily withheld until it is safe to continue.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### TRIPS Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are part of the TRIPS trial, you will receive the study drug or placebo every 12 hours for seven days. The drug will be infused over one hour each time. If you have severe renal dysfunction, the dose may be adjusted to ensure safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Follow-up Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout the study, we will perform follow-up immune function testing to monitor your response to the study drug. This involves additional blood draws to measure your immune response and inflammatory markers. These follow-up tests will occur twice weekly for two weeks and will help us understand how the study drug affects your immune system over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Biorepository Sample Collection\n",
       "\n",
       "As part of the study, we will collect additional biological samples, including blood and, if applicable, endotracheal aspirates. These samples will be used to answer questions about the biology of immune function and inflammation in children with sepsis-induced MODS. The total volume of blood collected will be adjusted based on your weight to ensure safety. These samples will be stored and may be used for future research related to this study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Collection\n",
       "\n",
       "We will collect various types of data throughout the study, including demographic information, eligibility data, and details about your medical history and current health status. We will also record information about the administration of the study drug, any adverse events, and your overall progress during the study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Monitoring and Safety\n",
       "\n",
       "Your safety is our top priority. We will closely monitor your health throughout the study, including regular assessments of your vital signs, laboratory results, and any changes in your condition. If you experience any adverse events or if your condition changes, we will take appropriate action to ensure your safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Discontinuation or Withdrawal\n",
       "\n",
       "You may be withdrawn from the study if you or your legal guardian decide to discontinue participation, or if it is determined that it is not in your best interest to continue. If you are withdrawn, we will stop all study procedures and data collection, but we will continue to review any data collected prior to your withdrawal.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "These procedures are designed to help us understand the effects of the study drug on children with sepsis-induced MODS and to improve outcomes for future patients. Your participation is valuable and contributes to important research in pediatric critical care.\n",

       "## Alternative Procedures\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You do not need to be part of this study to receive high-quality care for sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in a pediatric intensive care unit. The medical team will continue to provide state-of-the-art critical care based on current medical standards, regardless of your decision to participate. This includes the use of antibiotics and supportive care measures such as fluid resuscitation and the use of medications to support heart and lung function. \n",
       "\n",
       "Currently, monitoring of immune function and personalized immunomodulation are not part of routine care in pediatric ICUs. The study aims to explore whether specific treatments can improve outcomes by targeting the immune system, but these treatments are not yet standard practice. If you choose not to participate, your child will still receive all the necessary medical interventions that are typically used to manage sepsis and MODS. \n",
       "\n",
       "You can decide to stop participating in the study at any time, and this will not affect the care your child receives. If you choose to withdraw from the study, the medical team will continue to provide all necessary treatments as per usual care protocols. Your decision to participate or not will not impact the quality of care your child receives in any way.\n",

       "\n",
       "Participating in this study may offer you potential benefits, although it is important to understand that the effectiveness of the intervention is not yet known. The primary goal of this study is to improve outcomes for children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) by personalizing immune modulation based on individual immune phenotypes. If you are enrolled in the GRACE-2 trial, you may receive granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is being investigated for its potential to reverse immunoparalysis and enhance your immune response. This could potentially lead to a reduction in the duration and severity of organ dysfunction, and possibly improve your overall recovery from sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are enrolled in the TRIPS trial, you may receive anakinra, a medication that targets inflammation. This could potentially help in reducing the inflammatory response associated with sepsis, which might lead to a quicker resolution of organ dysfunction and a decrease in the risk of further complications. The study aims to tailor the treatment to your specific immune response, which could enhance the effectiveness of the intervention.\n",
       "\n",
       "While these potential benefits are promising, it is crucial to note that there is no guarantee that you will experience any direct health benefits from participating in this study. The interventions are experimental, and their efficacy in improving outcomes for sepsis-induced MODS is still being evaluated.\n",

       "Your participation in this study could contribute significantly to the advancement of medical knowledge and the development of more effective treatments for sepsis-induced MODS in children. By helping researchers understand how personalized immune modulation can impact the course of this condition, you are playing a vital role in potentially improving the standard of care for future patients.\n",
       "\n",
       "The data collected from your participation will help researchers identify specific immune phenotypes and how they respond to different treatments. This information could lead to the development of targeted therapies that are more effective and have fewer side effects than current treatment options. Additionally, the study may uncover new insights into the mechanisms of sepsis and MODS, which could inform the creation of novel therapeutic strategies.\n",
