       "You are being invited to consider allowing your child to participate in a research study because your child has been diagnosed with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and is receiving care in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU). This study, called the \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS (PRECISE)\" study, aims to explore new ways to improve outcomes for children suffering from this serious condition by using personalized treatment approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. When sepsis progresses to MODS, it leads to the failure of multiple organs, which significantly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Current treatments for sepsis largely focus on antibiotics and supportive care, but there is a need for more targeted therapies that address the specific immune responses in each patient.\n",
       "\n",
       "The PRECISE study seeks to personalize treatment based on your child's specific immune response to sepsis. Research has shown that children with sepsis-induced MODS can have different immune system responses. Some children may have a weakened immune response, while others may have an overly active immune response. This study will use blood tests to categorize your child's immune response and determine the most appropriate treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are two main treatment trials in the study: \n",
       "\n",
       "1. **GRACE-2 Trial:** This trial is for children whose blood tests show a weakened immune response (immunoparalysis) with mild to moderate inflammation. These children will receive either GM-CSF (a medication that stimulates the immune system) or a placebo.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **TRIPS Trial:** This trial is for children who have moderate to severe inflammation without immunoparalysis, or immunoparalysis with severe inflammation. These children will receive either anakinra (a medication that reduces inflammation) or a placebo.\n",
       "\n",
       "Participation in the study is entirely voluntary. If you choose to allow your child to participate, they will continue to receive standard medical care for sepsis-induced MODS, in addition to the study treatment. The primary goal of the study is to determine whether these personalized treatments can reduce the severity and duration of organ dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are potential risks and benefits to participating in this study. The risks include side effects from the study medications, which are generally mild but can include fever, chills, or allergic reactions. Blood draws for testing may also cause discomfort or bruising. The benefits include close monitoring of your child's condition and the potential for improved outcomes if the study treatments are effective. Additionally, by participating, you will contribute to research that may help improve treatments for other children with sepsis in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important to understand that participation is completely voluntary, and you can choose to withdraw your child from the study at any time without affecting their standard medical care. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign a consent form, and the study team will provide you with all necessary information and answer any questions you may have.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to important research that aims to enhance the care and treatment of children with sepsis-induced MODS."

       "## Background\n",
       "\n",
       "You are being invited to participate in a research study focused on improving the treatment of children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Sepsis is a serious medical condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs. This can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, where two or more organ systems in the body stop working properly. MODS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children, and current treatments are mostly supportive, such as antibiotics and medications to support blood pressure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The study is called \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS\" (PRECISE). The goal of this study is to test new treatments that are personalized to a child's specific immune response to sepsis. Researchers believe that by tailoring the treatment to fit the unique immune system response of each child, they can improve outcomes and reduce the severity and duration of organ dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this study, children with sepsis-induced MODS will be grouped into different categories based on their immune system's response to the infection. The categories include those with \"immunoparalysis,\" where the immune system is not responding strongly enough, and those with \"hyperinflammation,\" where the immune system is overactive.\n",
       "\n",
       "For children with immunoparalysis, the study will test a drug called GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). GM-CSF is a natural protein in the body that helps stimulate the immune system. The researchers believe that GM-CSF could help boost the immune response in children with immunoparalysis, potentially leading to faster recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "For children with hyperinflammation, the study will test a drug called anakinra. Anakinra is designed to reduce inflammation by blocking a specific protein in the immune system called interleukin-1. By dampening the overactive immune response, anakinra may help reduce the damage to organs caused by the inflammation.\n",
       "\n",
       "The scientific rationale behind these treatments is based on previous research that shows children with sepsis-induced MODS often have very different immune responses. Some children’s immune systems are underactive, while others are overactive. By identifying these different responses and treating them accordingly, the researchers hope to improve outcomes for children with this serious condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation will help the researchers understand whether these targeted treatments can effectively improve recovery in children with sepsis-induced MODS. The findings from this study may lead to more personalized and effective treatments for this condition in the future, potentially helping many children who suffer from severe sepsis."

       "This study is being conducted by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) across multiple hospitals, including children's hospitals and intensive care units within large academic health centers. The research is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The protocol aims to enroll up to 1,095 participants in total. Specifically, 500 subjects are expected to participate in the TRIPS trial, and 400 subjects in the GRACE-2 trial. The study will include infants, children, and adolescent patients admitted with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). It is anticipated that enrollment will take place over a four-year period. Participants will be identified and recruited by on-site study staff at the participating hospitals, with eligibility determined based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria related to their clinical condition. The study aims to assess the effects of personalized immune modulation on reducing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients with sepsis-induced MODS."

       "### Screening and Enrollment\n",
       "\n",
       "When you are admitted to the Pediatric or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, our research staff will check if you meet the criteria for participation in this study. This involves reviewing your medical records to ensure you have a documented or suspected infection that has led to the onset of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If you meet the criteria, a member of our team will discuss the study with your guardian(s) and ask for permission to proceed with enrollment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "Immune phenotyping is a crucial part of the study, which helps us understand how your immune system is responding to the infection that caused MODS. On the second day after MODS is identified, we will draw approximately 2 milliliters of blood. This blood sample will be used to measure your immune response and levels of certain inflammatory markers, like TNFα, ferritin, and CRP. These measurements will help determine the best course of treatment for you within the study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Randomization into Interventional Trials\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the results from immune phenotyping, you may be eligible for one of two interventional trials: the GRACE-2 trial or the TRIPS trial. The GRACE-2 trial involves the administration of GM-CSF (Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor) or a placebo, while the TRIPS trial involves treatment with anakinra or a placebo. Randomization means that you will be assigned to one of these groups by chance, similar to flipping a coin, to ensure the study results are unbiased.\n",
       "\n",
       "### GRACE-2 Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are randomized into the GRACE-2 trial, you will receive the study drug or placebo intravenously. The drug is infused over at least six hours each day for up to seven days. We will closely monitor your white blood cell count during this time. If your white blood cell count rises above a certain level, we may temporarily stop the infusion to ensure your safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "### TRIPS Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "For participants in the TRIPS trial, anakinra or a placebo will be administered every 12 hours through an intravenous line, with each dose taking about an hour to infuse. This treatment will continue for seven days. We will adjust the dose for participants with severe kidney dysfunction to ensure it is safe and effective.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Follow-up Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout the study, we will continue to monitor your immune system and inflammation levels. Additional blood samples will be collected twice a week for up to two weeks to track changes in your immune response. These follow-up tests will provide us with valuable information on how the treatment is affecting your immune system.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Biorepository Sample Collection and Processing\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to the regular immune phenotyping, we will collect small amounts of extra blood and, if applicable, endotracheal aspirates for a biorepository. These samples will be stored for future research related to the study to help us better understand sepsis-induced MODS and its treatment. Your guardian(s) will be asked for permission to store these samples, and they can decide whether they want to allow this.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Discontinuation of Study Drug\n",
       "\n",
       "If at any point during the study you experience adverse events that require stopping the study drug, we will discontinue the treatment. However, this does not mean you will be withdrawn from the study. We will continue to collect data and samples as part of the study procedures unless your guardian(s) request complete withdrawal from the study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Monitoring and Data Collection\n",
       "\n",
       "We will monitor your health closely throughout the study. This includes daily assessments of your organ function and any changes in your condition. We will collect data on your health status, treatments you receive, and any side effects you experience. This information will help us understand the effects of the study drugs and improve treatments for others in the future.\n",

       "## Study Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "You are being invited to consider allowing your child to participate in a research study because your child has been diagnosed with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and is receiving care in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU). This study, called the \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS (PRECISE)\" study, aims to explore new ways to improve outcomes for children suffering from this serious condition by using personalized treatment approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. When sepsis progresses to MODS, it leads to the failure of multiple organs, which significantly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Current treatments for sepsis largely focus on antibiotics and supportive care, but there is a need for more targeted therapies that address the specific immune responses in each patient.\n",
       "\n",
       "The PRECISE study seeks to personalize treatment based on your child's specific immune response to sepsis. Research has shown that children with sepsis-induced MODS can have different immune system responses. Some children may have a weakened immune response, while others may have an overly active immune response. This study will use blood tests to categorize your child's immune response and determine the most appropriate treatment.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are two main treatment trials in the study: \n",
       "\n",
       "1. **GRACE-2 Trial:** This trial is for children whose blood tests show a weakened immune response (immunoparalysis) with mild to moderate inflammation. These children will receive either GM-CSF (a medication that stimulates the immune system) or a placebo.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **TRIPS Trial:** This trial is for children who have moderate to severe inflammation without immunoparalysis, or immunoparalysis with severe inflammation. These children will receive either anakinra (a medication that reduces inflammation) or a placebo.\n",
       "\n",
       "Participation in the study is entirely voluntary. If you choose to allow your child to participate, they will continue to receive standard medical care for sepsis-induced MODS, in addition to the study treatment. The primary goal of the study is to determine whether these personalized treatments can reduce the severity and duration of organ dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are potential risks and benefits to participating in this study. The risks include side effects from the study medications, which are generally mild but can include fever, chills, or allergic reactions. Blood draws for testing may also cause discomfort or bruising. The benefits include close monitoring of your child's condition and the potential for improved outcomes if the study treatments are effective. Additionally, by participating, you will contribute to research that may help improve treatments for other children with sepsis in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important to understand that participation is completely voluntary, and you can choose to withdraw your child from the study at any time without affecting their standard medical care. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to sign a consent form, and the study team will provide you with all necessary information and answer any questions you may have.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to important research that aims to enhance the care and treatment of children with sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Background\n",
       "\n",
       "You are being invited to participate in a research study focused on improving the treatment of children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Sepsis is a serious medical condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs. This can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, where two or more organ systems in the body stop working properly. MODS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children, and current treatments are mostly supportive, such as antibiotics and medications to support blood pressure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The study is called \"PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS\" (PRECISE). The goal of this study is to test new treatments that are personalized to a child's specific immune response to sepsis. Researchers believe that by tailoring the treatment to fit the unique immune system response of each child, they can improve outcomes and reduce the severity and duration of organ dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this study, children with sepsis-induced MODS will be grouped into different categories based on their immune system's response to the infection. The categories include those with \"immunoparalysis,\" where the immune system is not responding strongly enough, and those with \"hyperinflammation,\" where the immune system is overactive.\n",
       "\n",
       "For children with immunoparalysis, the study will test a drug called GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). GM-CSF is a natural protein in the body that helps stimulate the immune system. The researchers believe that GM-CSF could help boost the immune response in children with immunoparalysis, potentially leading to faster recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "For children with hyperinflammation, the study will test a drug called anakinra. Anakinra is designed to reduce inflammation by blocking a specific protein in the immune system called interleukin-1. By dampening the overactive immune response, anakinra may help reduce the damage to organs caused by the inflammation.\n",
       "\n",
       "The scientific rationale behind these treatments is based on previous research that shows children with sepsis-induced MODS often have very different immune responses. Some children’s immune systems are underactive, while others are overactive. By identifying these different responses and treating them accordingly, the researchers hope to improve outcomes for children with this serious condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation will help the researchers understand whether these targeted treatments can effectively improve recovery in children with sepsis-induced MODS. The findings from this study may lead to more personalized and effective treatments for this condition in the future, potentially helping many children who suffer from severe sepsis.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Number of Participants\n",
       "\n",
       "This study is being conducted by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) across multiple hospitals, including children's hospitals and intensive care units within large academic health centers. The research is funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The protocol aims to enroll up to 1,095 participants in total. Specifically, 500 subjects are expected to participate in the TRIPS trial, and 400 subjects in the GRACE-2 trial. The study will include infants, children, and adolescent patients admitted with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). It is anticipated that enrollment will take place over a four-year period. Participants will be identified and recruited by on-site study staff at the participating hospitals, with eligibility determined based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria related to their clinical condition. The study aims to assess the effects of personalized immune modulation on reducing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients with sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Study Procedures\n",
       "\n",
       "### Screening and Enrollment\n",
       "\n",
       "When you are admitted to the Pediatric or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, our research staff will check if you meet the criteria for participation in this study. This involves reviewing your medical records to ensure you have a documented or suspected infection that has led to the onset of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If you meet the criteria, a member of our team will discuss the study with your guardian(s) and ask for permission to proceed with enrollment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "Immune phenotyping is a crucial part of the study, which helps us understand how your immune system is responding to the infection that caused MODS. On the second day after MODS is identified, we will draw approximately 2 milliliters of blood. This blood sample will be used to measure your immune response and levels of certain inflammatory markers, like TNFα, ferritin, and CRP. These measurements will help determine the best course of treatment for you within the study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Randomization into Interventional Trials\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the results from immune phenotyping, you may be eligible for one of two interventional trials: the GRACE-2 trial or the TRIPS trial. The GRACE-2 trial involves the administration of GM-CSF (Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor) or a placebo, while the TRIPS trial involves treatment with anakinra or a placebo. Randomization means that you will be assigned to one of these groups by chance, similar to flipping a coin, to ensure the study results are unbiased.\n",
       "\n",
       "### GRACE-2 Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are randomized into the GRACE-2 trial, you will receive the study drug or placebo intravenously. The drug is infused over at least six hours each day for up to seven days. We will closely monitor your white blood cell count during this time. If your white blood cell count rises above a certain level, we may temporarily stop the infusion to ensure your safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "### TRIPS Study Drug Administration\n",
       "\n",
       "For participants in the TRIPS trial, anakinra or a placebo will be administered every 12 hours through an intravenous line, with each dose taking about an hour to infuse. This treatment will continue for seven days. We will adjust the dose for participants with severe kidney dysfunction to ensure it is safe and effective.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Follow-up Immune Phenotyping\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout the study, we will continue to monitor your immune system and inflammation levels. Additional blood samples will be collected twice a week for up to two weeks to track changes in your immune response. These follow-up tests will provide us with valuable information on how the treatment is affecting your immune system.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Biorepository Sample Collection and Processing\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to the regular immune phenotyping, we will collect small amounts of extra blood and, if applicable, endotracheal aspirates for a biorepository. These samples will be stored for future research related to the study to help us better understand sepsis-induced MODS and its treatment. Your guardian(s) will be asked for permission to store these samples, and they can decide whether they want to allow this.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Discontinuation of Study Drug\n",
       "\n",
       "If at any point during the study you experience adverse events that require stopping the study drug, we will discontinue the treatment. However, this does not mean you will be withdrawn from the study. We will continue to collect data and samples as part of the study procedures unless your guardian(s) request complete withdrawal from the study.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Monitoring and Data Collection\n",
       "\n",
       "We will monitor your health closely throughout the study. This includes daily assessments of your organ function and any changes in your condition. We will collect data on your health status, treatments you receive, and any side effects you experience. This information will help us understand the effects of the study drugs and improve treatments for others in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion of Study Participation\n",
       "\n",
       "Once the study period is over, we may continue to follow up with you to understand the long-term effects of the treatments. This follow-up includes assessments at three and twelve months after the initial treatment period. We will use this information to evaluate the overall impact of the treatments on your health and quality of life.\n",
       "\n",
       "By participating in this study, you are contributing to important research that aims to improve the treatment and outcomes of children with sepsis-induced MODS. Thank you for considering being a part of this study.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Alternative Procedures\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. It is not required to be part of this study to receive high-quality medical care for sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). All children will continue to receive state-of-the-art critical care as per standard medical practices, regardless of their participation. This includes comprehensive support measures such as antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and other treatments as determined by their clinical team. Monitoring immune function and providing personalized immunomodulatory treatments, as proposed in this study, are not currently part of routine clinical practice. Therefore, no alternative treatments focused on adjusting or enhancing immune function specifically for sepsis-induced MODS are available outside this study. Parents can choose to discontinue their child’s participation in the study at any time, and any data collected up to that point will still contribute to the research.\n",

       "### Potential Benefits for You\n",
       "\n",
       "As a participant in this research study focused on pediatric sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), you may receive personalized treatment that targets specific immune responses. This approach aims to improve your recovery from sepsis-induced MODS by enhancing your immune function and potentially accelerating the healing process. If you are selected for one of the intervention groups, you will receive either GM-CSF or anakinra, based on your immune profile. These treatments are intended to help normalize immune function, facilitate infection clearance, and promote tissue healing, which may lead to a quicker resolution of organ failure.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important to understand that this is a research study, and while these interventions have shown promise in previous studies, it is not yet confirmed if they will be effective for you. The primary goal is to assess the effectiveness of these treatments in reducing the severity and duration of organ dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Potential Benefits for Others\n",
       "\n",
       "Your participation in this study could contribute significantly to the advancement of medical knowledge and the development of new treatment strategies for pediatric sepsis-induced MODS. By participating, you are helping researchers gather important data that may lead to more effective and personalized treatments for children suffering from similar conditions in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "The insights gained from this research could potentially reduce mortality and improve outcomes for critically ill children by identifying and validating new therapeutic approaches. This study aims to establish whether personalized immunomodulation can be a beneficial strategy, potentially influencing future clinical practices and improving the standard of care for pediatric patients with sepsis-induced MODS.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, the study will provide valuable information about the immune responses in sepsis-induced MODS, which could help in understanding the disease better and tailoring treatments for individual patients based on their unique immune profiles.
