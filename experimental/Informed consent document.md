## Study Summary

You are being invited to allow your child to participate in a research study because your child is potentially eligible due to their admission to a Pediatric or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study, called the "PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS (PRECISE)," aims to explore new ways to treat children with this condition by tailoring treatments to their specific immune responses.

Sepsis is a serious medical condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In some cases, this can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), where two or more organ systems in the body stop working properly. The current standard treatment for sepsis involves antibiotics and supportive care, such as fluids and medications to support blood pressure. However, these treatments are not personalized to the individual needs of each child.

The PRECISE study seeks to change this by using a personalized approach to treatment. Researchers have found that children with sepsis-induced MODS can have different immune responses. Some children may have an overactive immune response, while others may have an underactive one. By identifying these differences, the study aims to provide treatments that are specifically targeted to each child's immune response.

The study involves two main trials: the GRACE-2 trial and the TRIPS trial. In the GRACE-2 trial, children with an underactive immune response will receive a medication called GM-CSF, which is designed to stimulate the immune system, or a placebo, which is an inactive substance. In the TRIPS trial, children with an overactive immune response will receive a medication called anakinra, which helps reduce inflammation, or a placebo. The goal is to see if these targeted treatments can improve outcomes for children with sepsis-induced MODS.

Participation in the study is entirely voluntary, and you can choose to withdraw your child at any time without affecting their medical care. If you decide to allow your child to participate, they will undergo immune testing to determine their specific immune response. Based on the results, they may be enrolled in one of the trials or be part of an observational group if they do not meet the criteria for the trials.

There are potential risks and benefits to participating in the study. The risks include possible side effects from the study medications, such as fever, chills, or allergic reactions. However, these risks are generally considered to be low. The potential benefits include receiving a treatment that is specifically tailored to your child's immune response, which may improve their recovery from sepsis-induced MODS. Additionally, the knowledge gained from this study may help improve treatments for other children with similar conditions in the future.

It is important to understand that participation in this study is completely voluntary. You have the right to ask questions and discuss the study with the research team before making a decision. If you choose not to participate, your child will continue to receive the standard care for sepsis-induced MODS.

We hope this summary provides you with a clear understanding of the study and helps you make an informed decision about your child's participation. Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute to important research that may benefit children with sepsis-induced MODS.

## Background

You are being approached to participate in a research study focused on improving the treatment of a serious condition known as sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in children. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. When sepsis leads to the failure of multiple organs, it is referred to as MODS, which significantly increases the risk of death and long-term health issues.

The study you are being considered for is called the "PeRsonalizEd immunomodulation in pediatriC sepsIS-inducEd MODS" (PRECISE) study. This research is being conducted by the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network, a group of hospitals and research centers dedicated to improving the care of critically ill children. The study aims to explore new ways to treat sepsis-induced MODS by tailoring treatments to the specific immune responses of individual patients.

In sepsis, the immune system, which normally fights infections, can become either overactive or underactive. An overactive immune response can lead to excessive inflammation, while an underactive response can result in immunoparalysis, where the immune system is too weak to fight off infections effectively. Both scenarios can contribute to the development and worsening of MODS.

The PRECISE study is investigating two main treatment strategies based on the patient's immune response. The first strategy involves using a drug called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to boost the immune system in patients who show signs of immunoparalysis. GM-CSF is a naturally occurring protein in the body that stimulates the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting infections. The researchers believe that by enhancing the immune response with GM-CSF, they can help the body better combat infections and reduce organ dysfunction.

The second strategy focuses on patients with excessive inflammation. For these patients, the study is testing a drug called anakinra, which is designed to reduce inflammation by blocking the activity of a specific protein involved in the inflammatory process. Anakinra is already used to treat other inflammatory conditions, and the researchers hope that it can help control the harmful inflammation seen in sepsis-induced MODS.

The study is designed to identify the specific immune profile of each patient and then assign them to the appropriate treatment group. This personalized approach aims to provide the most effective treatment based on the individual's unique immune response, rather than a one-size-fits-all method.

By participating in this study, you will be contributing to important research that could lead to better treatments for sepsis-induced MODS in children. The knowledge gained from this study may help improve outcomes for children with this condition in the future.

## Study Procedures

### Screening and Enrollment

You will be evaluated for eligibility to participate in this study if you are admitted to the pediatric or cardiac intensive care unit. If you meet the initial criteria, we will record your information in our data system. If you are eligible, we will approach your legal guardian(s) to discuss the study and seek their permission for you to participate. Your participation will involve immune phenotyping and possibly being part of an interventional trial based on the results of your immune phenotyping.

### Immune Phenotyping

On the second day after the onset of sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), we will perform immune phenotyping if your condition persists. This involves drawing approximately 2 milliliters of blood to measure your immune response and inflammation levels. The blood sample will be processed on-site and then shipped to a specialized laboratory for analysis. The results will help determine your eligibility for further study procedures.

### Randomization and Study Drug Administration

If you qualify based on your immune phenotyping results, you may be randomized into one of two trials: the GRACE-2 trial or the TRIPS trial. 

#### GRACE-2 Trial

If you are part of the GRACE-2 trial, you will receive either the study drug GM-CSF or a placebo. The study drug will be administered intravenously over at least six hours daily for seven days. We will monitor your white blood cell count before the first and fourth doses to ensure it is safe to continue the treatment.

#### TRIPS Trial

If you are part of the TRIPS trial, you will receive either the study drug anakinra or a placebo. The drug will be administered intravenously every 12 hours for seven days. The dose will be adjusted based on your kidney function to ensure safety.

### Follow-up Immune Function Testing

Throughout the study, we will conduct follow-up immune function tests to monitor your response to the study drug. These tests will occur on specific days after you start receiving the study drug and will involve additional blood draws. The samples will be processed and analyzed to understand how your immune system is responding to the treatment.

### Biorepository Sample Collection

We will collect additional biological samples, including blood and possibly endotracheal aspirates if you are intubated, to help us understand the biology of immune function and inflammation. These samples will be stored for future analysis related to this study.

### Data Collection

We will collect various types of data throughout the study, including demographic information, eligibility data, and details about your hospital stay and treatments. We will also collect information about any adverse events you experience during the study.

### Quality of Life Assessments

We will assess your quality of life at the start of the study and at follow-up intervals using specific questionnaires. These assessments will help us understand the impact of the study treatments on your overall well-being.

### Monitoring and Safety

Your safety is our top priority. We will closely monitor you for any adverse events or changes in your condition throughout the study. If any serious issues arise, we will take appropriate action, which may include discontinuing the study drug.

### Discontinuation or Withdrawal

You or your guardians can choose to withdraw from the study at any time. If you are withdrawn, we will stop all study procedures and data collection, but we will continue to review any data collected before your withdrawal.

These procedures are designed to ensure your safety and to help us understand how to better treat sepsis-induced MODS in children. Your participation is valuable in advancing medical knowledge and improving future treatments.

## Alternative Procedures

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You do not need to be part of this study to receive high-quality care for sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in a pediatric intensive care unit. The medical team will continue to provide state-of-the-art critical care based on current medical standards, regardless of your decision to participate. This includes comprehensive monitoring and treatment tailored to your child's needs, as determined by the healthcare professionals.

Currently, monitoring of immune function and personalized immunomodulation are not standard practices in routine ICU care for children with sepsis. The study aims to explore these areas to potentially improve outcomes, but they are not part of the usual care provided. There are no other treatments specifically designed to enhance immune function or reduce inflammation that are routinely used in children with sepsis outside of this research context.

If you choose not to participate, your child will still receive all necessary medical interventions to manage their condition effectively. You can also decide to withdraw from the study at any time, and this will not affect the care your child receives. The decision to participate or not will not impact the quality of medical attention and support provided by the healthcare team.
