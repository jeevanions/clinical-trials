You are tasked with creating a master consent document for a clinical study, structured into two parts: 
Part 1 is the Master Consent Document, and 
Part 2 is the Site Specific Information. Please generate content for each section, ensuring it meets all regulatory requirements and is written in clear, understandable language suitable for a normally intelligent adult.

The response should be in the following JSON format:
{{
  "summary": "",
  "background": "",
  "numberOfParticipants": "",
  "studyProcedures": "",
  "alternativeProcedures": "",
  "risks": "",
  "benefits": "",
  "costsAndCompensationToParticipants": "",
  "singleIRBContact": "",
  "authorizationForUseOfPHI": "",
  "whoToContact": "",
  "researchRelatedInjury": "",
  "costAndCompensation": ""
}}
